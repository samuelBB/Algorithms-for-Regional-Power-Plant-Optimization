# Algorithms-for-Regional-Power-Plant-Optimization

This project supplies algorithms (both optimal and approximate) for various optimization problems relating to regional power plant production. Rather than consider plants as individual entities, we consider plants in some region as a unified system, a seek to either: a) maximize aggregate power production subject to environmental constraints related to pollution, or b) minimize the effects of pollution subject to a mandated power threshold that must be met (these related variants are in some sense dual). Where possible, we provide efficient optimal algorithms (e.g. greedy or DP). In the case of NP-hard variants, approximation algorithms are provided (e.g. PTAS).

The motivation for this unified model is as follows: We consider thermoelectric plants (nationally prevalent), which withdraw water from an adjacent water source (e.g. a river) for cooling purposes. Used water, in the common once-through (OT) model, is ejected back to the river at higher temperature. This thermal pollution degrades the efficiency of plants downstream, since inlet water is less amenable to cooling use. Regionally, plants commonly lie along an interconnected river network, whence optimizing power production in a region necessarily must consider a grouping of plants and inter-plant effects on efficiency due to thermal pollution.
